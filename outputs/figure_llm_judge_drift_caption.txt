Figure X: LLM Judge drift vs.\ deterministic CodeGuard policy on RepoTrap-50 (15 runs: 3 models $\times$ 5 prompt variants, all at temperature=0). FBR = False Block Rate; ASR = Attack Success Rate; lower is better for both axes. Rectangles show the min--max range of ASR and FBR for each LLM judge; center markers indicate the midpoint and error bars show $\pm 1\sigma$. The inset zooms into the CodeGuard region. Despite identical temperature settings, LLM judges exhibit substantial drift: gpt-4o's FBR ranges from 16\% to 28\% and ASR from 0\% to 12\% depending solely on prompt wording. CodeGuard's four policy modes (X, +, $\triangle$, $\triangledown$) are deterministic fixed points with zero variance ($\sigma=0$). STRICT-EXEMPT achieves the ideal point (ASR=0\%, FBR=0\%). Note: STRICT-EXEMPT is jittered by +0.15\% on both axes for visibility.
